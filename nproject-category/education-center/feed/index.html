<p>Federal hospital law guarantees a person&#8217;s right to choose the home care provider that he or she wants in their home following discharge from a hospital. This is an important health care right and we understand how difficult this decision can be.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-226 size-full" src="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="1001" srcset="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b.jpeg 1500w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-585x390.jpeg 585w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-1200x801.jpeg 1200w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-100x67.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>There are many options available for obtaining care, and we respect your right to choose the services that meet your unique home care needs. If you are being discharged from a hospital, the Discharge Planner should work with you and your family to understand your individual home care needs based on your condition and expected recovery.</p>
<p>If home care is recommended, and you are insured through Medicare, the hospital is required to give you a list of all the home care agencies that can serve you at home, in addition to any hospital sponsored or owned home care services. It is your choice to decide who comes in your home and cares for you.</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 prohibits discrimination of post-hospital referrals to home health agencies and other entities.</p>
<p>SEC 4321 entitled &#8220;NONDISCRIMINATION IN POST-HOSPITAL REFERRAL TO HOME HEALTH AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES&#8221; pertains to notification of availability of home health agencies and other entities as part of the discharge planning process.  This section is amended to add &#8220;Consistent with section 1802, the discharge plan shall not specify or otherwise limit the qualified provider which may provide post-hospital home health services and identify any entity to whom the individual is referred in which the hospital has a disclosable financial interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the discharge planning process, hospitals are required to include &#8220;the availability of home health services through individuals and entities that participate in the Medicare Program and that serve the area in which the patient resides and that request to be listed by the hospital as available.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember, it is your right to choose your home health care provider.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="margin-top: -30px;">Home care: Combining Affordability and Convenience</h5>
<p>When it comes to health care, cost is an important consideration to take. No one wants to sacrifice quality to save a few bucks, and luckily there are options to suit every senior&#8217;s unique needs and limitations.  The infographic above outlines some of the key factors that point to at-home care as a reliable, convenient and affordable option. Here are also a few things to remember when making the home care decision for yourself or a loved one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-220" src="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0.jpeg" alt="img" srcset="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0.jpeg 1500w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-585x390.jpeg 585w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-100x67.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<h5>Inpatient Facilities vs. Home Options</h5>
<p>According to statistics from John Hancock, a nursing home with a private room can cost more than $94,000 per year, a rate that&#8217;s rising by about 3.6 percent each year. A semi-private room offers some of savings, but at $82,855 annually may still be expensive for some families. Assisted living facilities, which provide seniors with care tailored to their needs, can cost more than $41,000 each year, with prices rising by 2 percent yearly.</p>
<p>Elderly individuals who need daily help getting dressed, bathing, cooking and carrying out other day-to-day activities but don&#8217;t necessarily need regular medical care may be best suited for a home health aide. In 2013, a professional caregiver cost American families on average about $29,600 each year &#8211; or roughly $19 per hour. Additionally, the cost of an aide is only rising by 1.3 percent yearly, meaning that families can budget ahead securely. Further, statistics show that an at-home caregiver may actually save patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder up to $300 per month as a result of reduced trips to the emergency room and fewer hospitalizations.</p>
<h5>Maintaining a Quality Life</h5>
<p>For many older people, keeping a good quality of life trumps cost. The American Association of Retired Persons reports that home care is the choice of 82 percent of seniors because it doesn&#8217;t disrupt the life they&#8217;ve built for themselves. This kind of care allows seniors to maintain their relationships and homes while still getting the attention and help they need. Additionally, when seniors are being taken care of as soon as the need arises, they tend to have better health outcomes down the road, according to the AARP.</p>

That makes it difficult to make sure their daily needs are addressed, especially if illness or chronic disease strikes. It is possible to put together a long distance care team that will provide for your loved one and give you some peace of mind. Here are some tips on how to put together a reliable team that will serve the best interests of the senior you love.<\/p>\n<h5>1. Ask the senior how you can be most helpful<\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>What do they need daily?<\/li>\n<li>What tasks are difficult for them?<\/li>\n<li>Do they have regular weekly or monthly appointments \u2013 hair, physician etc. that they need transportation to and from?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>2. Talk to the senior\u2019s physician<\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>If the senior is willing to give you written permission, or you are the health care proxy, ask the physician to update you about the senior\u2019s health. You can also discuss this with your loved one, but often seniors will hide information about their health condition for fear of losing their independence. You need to know exactly what the health impairments are in order to address them appropriately.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not have permission or are not the health care proxy the physician cannot, by law, release private medical information to you. However, he or she may be willing to suggest the types of support that think will be most helpful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>3. Talk to friends, family members, neighbors of your loved one<\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Can a schedule of support and help be created?<\/li>\n<li>Can a neighbor\u2019s child take out the garbage or walk your loved one\u2019s dog?<\/li>\n<li>Can a sibling who lives close by take your loved one grocery shopping?<\/li>\n<li>Can neighbors or family members check in the senior regularly, especially during extreme hot and cold weather?<\/li>\n<li>Make sure everyone has all your phone numbers, your e-mail and other contact information.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5>4. Rely on local resources<\/h5>\n<p>There are many organizations that provide support for seniors. You can find the ones in your loved one\u2019s area by checking these sources of information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eldercare Locator, 1-800-677-1116 (toll-free)<\/li>\n<li>National Institute on Aging website<\/li>\n<li>Family Care Navigator<\/li>\n<li>Your state government\u2019s website, search for \u201celder care\u201d, \u201csenior care\u201d, or \u201cINSERT STATE NAME Executive Office of Elder Affairs.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Home Care agencies can also be a great resource to rely on. Certified, professional home caregivers can take care of your loved one and keep you updated on their condition.<\/p>\n<h5>5. Keep detailed records<\/h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a 3-ring binder in which you can keep notes, medical records, insurance information, calendars and even printed copies of emails.

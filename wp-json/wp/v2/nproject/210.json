No one wants to sacrifice quality to save a few bucks, and luckily there are options to suit every senior&#8217;s unique needs and limitations.\u00a0 The infographic above outlines some of the key factors that point to at-home care as a reliable, convenient and affordable option. Here are also a few things to remember when making the home care decision for yourself or a loved one.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-220\" src=\"https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/2017\/03\/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0.jpeg\" alt=\"img\" srcset=\"https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-585x390.jpeg 585w, https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-100x67.jpeg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h5>Inpatient Facilities vs. Home Options<\/h5>\n<p>According to statistics from John Hancock, a nursing home with a private room can cost more than $94,000 per year, a rate that&#8217;s rising by about 3.6 percent each year. A semi-private room offers some of savings, but at $82,855 annually may still be expensive for some families. Assisted living facilities, which provide seniors with care tailored to their needs, can cost more than $41,000 each year, with prices rising by 2 percent yearly.<\/p>\n<p>Elderly individuals who need daily help getting dressed, bathing, cooking and carrying out other day-to-day activities but don&#8217;t necessarily need regular medical care may be best suited for a home health aide. In 2013, a professional caregiver cost American families on average about $29,600 each year &#8211; or roughly $19 per hour. Additionally, the cost of an aide is only rising by 1.3 percent yearly, meaning that families can budget ahead securely. Further, statistics show that an at-home caregiver may actually save patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder up to $300 per month as a result of reduced trips to the emergency room and fewer hospitalizations.<\/p>\n<h5>Maintaining a Quality Life<\/h5>\n<p>For many older people, keeping a good quality of life trumps cost. The American Association of Retired Persons reports that home care is the choice of 82 percent of seniors because it doesn&#8217;t disrupt the life they&#8217;ve built for themselves. This kind of care allows seniors to maintain their relationships and homes while still getting the attention and help they need. Additionally, when seniors are being taken care of as soon as the need arises, they tend to have better health outcomes down the road, according to the AARP.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Home care: Combining Affordability and Convenience When it comes to health care, cost is an impor","protected":false},"featured_media":220,"template":"","nproject-category":[30],"nproject-tag":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/nproject\/210"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/nproject"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/nproject"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/220"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=210"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"nproject-category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/nproject-category?post=210"},{"taxonomy":"nproject-tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/enhancedcarers.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/nproject-tag?post=210"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

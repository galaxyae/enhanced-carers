										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="margin-top: -30px;">You Have the Right to Choose Your Home Health Care Service Provider</h5>
<p>Federal hospital law guarantees a person&#8217;s right to choose the home care provider that he or she wants in their home following discharge from a hospital. This is an important health care right and we understand how difficult this decision can be.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-226 size-full" src="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="1001" srcset="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b.jpeg 1500w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-585x390.jpeg 585w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-1200x801.jpeg 1200w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1489066124153-16096111ea0b-100x67.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>There are many options available for obtaining care, and we respect your right to choose the services that meet your unique home care needs. If you are being discharged from a hospital, the Discharge Planner should work with you and your family to understand your individual home care needs based on your condition and expected recovery.</p>
<p>If home care is recommended, and you are insured through Medicare, the hospital is required to give you a list of all the home care agencies that can serve you at home, in addition to any hospital sponsored or owned home care services. It is your choice to decide who comes in your home and cares for you.</p>
<p>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 prohibits discrimination of post-hospital referrals to home health agencies and other entities.</p>
<p>SEC 4321 entitled &#8220;NONDISCRIMINATION IN POST-HOSPITAL REFERRAL TO HOME HEALTH AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES&#8221; pertains to notification of availability of home health agencies and other entities as part of the discharge planning process.  This section is amended to add &#8220;Consistent with section 1802, the discharge plan shall not specify or otherwise limit the qualified provider which may provide post-hospital home health services and identify any entity to whom the individual is referred in which the hospital has a disclosable financial interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the discharge planning process, hospitals are required to include &#8220;the availability of home health services through individuals and entities that participate in the Medicare Program and that serve the area in which the patient resides and that request to be listed by the hospital as available.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember, it is your right to choose your home health care provider.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consumers are becoming more involved in their health care decisions and as a result, they are asking more questions. Many of these questions are related to the needs of the elderly and they are being directed to people who are not necessarily equipped to answer them.</p>
<p>While most Trusted Advisors have a degree of comfort when it comes to things such as estate planning and managing client portfolios, when it comes to making sure elderly clients are healthy and secure in their homes, it&#8217;s often a different story.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve prepared a handy discussion guide for Trusted Advisors to use in consulting with their clients. It&#8217;s designed to help Advisors identify issues of importance and compare the consequences of the different choices of care that are available at local NanoCare franchise locations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 style="margin-top: -30px;">Home care: Combining Affordability and Convenience</h5>
<p>When it comes to health care, cost is an important consideration to take. No one wants to sacrifice quality to save a few bucks, and luckily there are options to suit every senior&#8217;s unique needs and limitations.  The infographic above outlines some of the key factors that point to at-home care as a reliable, convenient and affordable option. Here are also a few things to remember when making the home care decision for yourself or a loved one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-220" src="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0.jpeg" alt="img" srcset="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0.jpeg 1500w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-585x390.jpeg 585w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1461354464878-ad92f492a5a0-100x67.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<h5>Inpatient Facilities vs. Home Options</h5>
<p>According to statistics from John Hancock, a nursing home with a private room can cost more than $94,000 per year, a rate that&#8217;s rising by about 3.6 percent each year. A semi-private room offers some of savings, but at $82,855 annually may still be expensive for some families. Assisted living facilities, which provide seniors with care tailored to their needs, can cost more than $41,000 each year, with prices rising by 2 percent yearly.</p>
<p>Elderly individuals who need daily help getting dressed, bathing, cooking and carrying out other day-to-day activities but don&#8217;t necessarily need regular medical care may be best suited for a home health aide. In 2013, a professional caregiver cost American families on average about $29,600 each year &#8211; or roughly $19 per hour. Additionally, the cost of an aide is only rising by 1.3 percent yearly, meaning that families can budget ahead securely. Further, statistics show that an at-home caregiver may actually save patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder up to $300 per month as a result of reduced trips to the emergency room and fewer hospitalizations.</p>
<h5>Maintaining a Quality Life</h5>
<p>For many older people, keeping a good quality of life trumps cost. The American Association of Retired Persons reports that home care is the choice of 82 percent of seniors because it doesn&#8217;t disrupt the life they&#8217;ve built for themselves. This kind of care allows seniors to maintain their relationships and homes while still getting the attention and help they need. Additionally, when seniors are being taken care of as soon as the need arises, they tend to have better health outcomes down the road, according to the AARP.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-top: -30px;">Home care can help for short periods of time, for extended periods, or around-the-clock in certain circumstances. Here are the most common reasons families set up home care for a loved one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-221" src="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/03/photo-1449495169669-7b118f960251.jpeg" alt="img" srcset="https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1449495169669-7b118f960251.jpeg 1500w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1449495169669-7b118f960251-585x390.jpeg 585w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1449495169669-7b118f960251-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1449495169669-7b118f960251-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://enhancedcarers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/photo-1449495169669-7b118f960251-100x67.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<h5>Support with daily activities</h5>
<p>If an older loved one becomes frail or weakened by the progression of an illness or age-related condition, it’s a good time to get extra help at home. This allows your parent or grandparent to continue to live independently in the home they love, getting the support they need to stay safe and happy. This type of care is all about maintaining a good quality of life with maximum independence.</p>
<h5>After the death of a spouse</h5>
<p>Home care can also be very helpful when a spouse passes. The older loved one now living alone may want companionship or need help with meals, household chores, or driving, as well as support staying active and connected with friends and the community.</p>
<h5>When a caregiver needs a break</h5>
<p>Something as simple as a family vacation, a change in a family caregiver’s work schedule, a sick child, or caregiver fatigue can also trigger a need for home care. When a family caregiver can’t be there or needs a break to rest and recharge, this type of care is called respite care. Whether it’s for a few hours, a few days, or more, respite care is highly recommended for family caregivers, especially when caring for a loved one with a chronic condition or progressive disease such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, or other dementia.</p>
<h5>After a serious medical episode</h5>
<p>Home care can also be very helpful after a serious medical episode, such as a stroke, heart attack, major surgery, or bad fall. Your physician may recommend professional care to support optimum recovery and rehabilitation at home following discharge. In many cases, setting up professional home care is a requirement for discharge from a hospital or medical facility.</p>
<h5>For a chronic condition or illness</h5>
<p>In addition to supporting daily activities and providing companionship, home care is also helpful when caring for a loved one with a chronic condition or serious illness at home. This type of specialized care can offer families many benefits: respite care or additional support for family caregivers, assistance when a loved one needs care overnight, help with transferring, lifting, and toileting, as well as managing illness symptoms and treatment side-effects. Setting up quality, personalized home care for someone with a chronic condition or illness can enable that person to continue to live at home with greater safety and comfort.</p>
<h5>When time is limited</h5>
<p>Near the end of life, home care provides families and their loved ones emotional support and compassionate assistance to improve physical comfort during this difficult time. A care professional can help support hospice workers, provide assistance with personal care when hospice workers aren’t present, or simply be there—24/7 if necessary—so no one ever has to be alone in their final hours. An experienced care professional also knows the best practices and procedures for assisting a person at the end of their life with compassion and sensitivity.</p>
